Those who are in rule worry about social unrest.
* diminish legitimacy of ruling authorities, which essentially translates into
  risk of regime change, whether through violent revolution or through a
  democratic transitino of power.
* these days: economic losses
* administration of the state becomes ineffective (for instance, refusal to
  implement NPR in India?)

But it's not so straightforward.
1. ruling class is not unified...
2. does the ruling class actually worry about social unrest? What evidence do we
   have that American elites have this concern?
3. Of course there is also some notion of competence. The ruling class may be
   concerned about social unrest in the abstract but not be able to foresee how
   it may occur or take the right precautionary measures to undercut potential
   unrest.
   
Coronavirus... Does it indicate that American elites are smart or dumb?

At some level, American elites seem to have been quite successful in the sense
that America has some of the most regressive labor laws and corporate power is
strong, etc.

However, the completely bungled response to the coronavirus seems to suggest
some kind of failure by the ruling class. It seems straightforward to argue that
a severe coronavirus crisis is causing major economic losses that could have
been minimized with a faster response.

Well, one reason could be that a tool that was successful has run away with
itself. A sort of anti-liberal/elite playbook that has worked so well led to a
knee-jerk reaction.

Or it could just be short-sightedness: a faster coronavirus response would have
required earlier economic losses, before it was **concretely** clear how bad
coronavirus could get. (We could understand it abstractly with models but maybe
the West couldn't quite imagine the sort of devastation it would wreak. Images
from China are unrelatable not only because it's culturally too distant but also
because it's easier to imagine the draconian responses in China but not in the West.)

Yet 

Ultimately one big source of difficulty is knowing how to assess different
pieces of ruling elite discourse. For instance, I get the newsletter from NYT
Dealbook. To what extent does that reflect elite discourse?

Some quotes from _The Will To Improve_.... but actually I don't know how much we
can take these quotes without digging further. They are just a couple comments
from certain people and I don't know who they are.

They are from a chapter of _The Foucault Effect_ titled "Social economy and the
government of poverty." I really couldn't bring myself to read the chapter,
after reading the first two pages. The first quote is given as the opening
quote:

> Assisting the poor is a means of government, a potent way of containing the
> most difficult section of the population and improving all other sections.

No explanation is given of who said this and in what context.

I wonder whether Tania Murray Li made an error of some sort in the second case.
She writes, "In Britain in 1847, for example, an observer argued for special
programs for paupers because they were 'the class of men injured by society woh
consequently rebel against it.'" (2007: 8). However this quote, taken from that
chapter of _The Foucault Effect_ (1991) written by Giovanna Procacci, is
actually by a man named François Félix de Lafarelle who seems to be a wholly
French magistrate... It seems unlikely that he would be writing in French about
Britain?

Amazingly, I found the book on Archive.org
[here](https://archive.org/details/duprogrssociala01faregoog/page/n12/mode/2up).

I looked at page 7, based on the citation by Procacci. There is discussion of
Adam Smith, but although I cannot say I read the French extremely carefully, I
could not find the quote "Pauperism is the class of men injured by society who
consequently rebel against it". I suppose the translation of pauperism is either
le paupérisme or more likely in this case, l'indigence, since that seems to be
the word used... can't find it though. Sigh... this is a dead end. And I feel
somewhat disappointed at this referencing.

I'm often told that the CCCP knows about managing social unrest. (a) they
themselves were born of a peasant rebellion, so they would want to be sure that
no other peasant rebellion arises. (b) they would have had some exchanges with
the Soviets, or at least studied the Soviet government. And I assume the USSR
had lots of techniques of social repression. (c) I've been told about how
sending people to the countryside during the cultural revolution was aimed at
reducing social unrest (splits people up, breaks up a lot of social ties, move
them to an unknown surrounding). (d) I was told that after the Cultural
revolution colleges were meant to prevent having too many idle youth, which can
frequently be a source of radical politics.
