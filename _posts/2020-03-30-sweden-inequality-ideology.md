Collecting examples to show that "another world is possible." One way is to
show how much things have changed in history, especially in unexpected ways.
In this [interview], Thomas Piketty gives an example from his latest book,
_Capital and Ideology_ of how political and economic inequality in Sweden has
changed dramatically since the turn of the 20th century.

> Inequality is a political construction, not the product of “natural” forces
> of the economy or technology. Every society needs to tell itself a plausible
> story to show why inequalities are acceptable, to justify the organization
> of social groups, and to explain the nature of property, borders, the tax
> system, and education. Revisiting this story allows us to see our current
> ideologies from a different perspective. We often have the impression that
> inequalities from the past were necessarily unfair and despotic and that
> those of the present are necessarily meritocratic, dynamic, open. I do not
> believe a word of it. Macron's “leaders in the rope line,” the job creators
> of Trump, the glorification of fortune whatever its number of zeros: all
> this speech is as religious in its way as traditional and explicitly
> religious justifications for inequality

> History shows that it is impossible to predict the evolution of regimes of
> inequality. Take Sweden: we sometimes like to say that the Swedish social
> model feeds on a very old culture, going back to the Vikings. In fact,
> Sweden was for a long time an extremely unequal country. The census system
> until 1911 stipulated that the owners of the biggest fortunes could have up
> to one hundred votes per person! Political mobilizations have transformed
> the country. If someone had predicted in 1910 that Sweden would become
> a social democratic country, nobody would have taken it seriously. That’s
> why I do not believe that the current system is indestructible or cannot be
> transformed.

I tried to find a source to corroborate this. I found this [article] in _Past
& Present_, which I believe is a well-respected academic journal of history.

> The Swedish election system was even more unequal on the local level. In the
> municipalities, established in 1862, a minimum level of income or wealth was
> necessary for the right to vote, and among those with the right to vote, the
> number of votes was distributed according to their income and/or wealth. In
> urban municipalities, an individual (which could also be a company) could
> control up to one hundred votes or 2 per cent of the total votes (5 per cent
> before 1869); in rural municipalities, there was no such limit. This
> infamously led to several municipalities being ruled by a ‘dictator’ in the
> sense that one single individual controlled more than half of the votes. In
> 1871 this was the case in 54 municipalities, while in 414 localities, more
> than a quarter of the votes were controlled by a single individual. In the
> 1880s, the cousin of the prime minister Count Arvid Posse was one of the
> local ‘dictators’, due to the value of his family estate.34 As Mellquist put
> it, all countries in Europe restricted the franchise of the poor, but none
> were as extreme as the Swedish system.
