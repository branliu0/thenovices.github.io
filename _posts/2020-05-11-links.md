Majority Action's [submission][ma] for the JPMorgan Chase annual shareholder meeting
(to be held May 19, 2020) titled "Vote AGAINST Lee Raymond For Independent and
Climate Competent Governance at JPMorgan Chase (JPM)." The first time I've
personally seen a sample of shareholder activism, something I've learned a bit
about in the last couple days.

Fantastic [report][divest] from Oxford from 2013 on the impact of fossil fuel
divestment, for being extremely informative, clearly presented, and combining
financial and sociological insights into markets. In short, direct impacts from
divestment campaigns (i.e., literal money divested) is probably minimal, but
indirect effects of stigmatization and increased likelihood of restrictive
legislation can lead to increased uncertainty of future cash flows which can
cause greater financial impact.

Good overview in [NYRB][biomass] on context around use of biomass for
electricity. I suppose it serves as a case of how legislation and regulations
that are environmental and sustainable in name can contain loopholes and
exceptions that lead to environmentally destructive outcomes. Another example
would be the exempting of fracking fluids from multiple environmental protection
laws in the [2005 Energy Policy
Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005).

Great [powerpoint][ubi] from _interfluidity_, a blog I've only just recently
discovered, on the benefits of UBI from a highly economistic perspective.
