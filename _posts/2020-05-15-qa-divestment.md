Two weeks ago, climate activists [celebrated][stopmoney] the news that former
Exxon CEO Lee Raymond would not be returning as Lead Independent Director of
JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors next term. Lee Raymond has long been vilified by
the environmental movement as one of the key architects of climate denialism
throughout his long career in oil and gas. Although it's unclear to me whether
this change is substantive or decorative (as he still retains his board position
and other board leadership roles, no doubt in great part due to his 33 years of
tenure on the board), activist groups such as the Stop the Money Pipeline
Coalition, touted the victory as a result of "pressur[ing] Wall Street
Institutions to stop financing fossil fuels."

This episode highlights the antinomy between the twin tactics of
shareholder activism and divestment campaigns. It seems to me that the
"demotion" of Lee Raymond is more likely due to shareholder activism than
divestment, although it's hard to say what the real causes were. The [_Wall Street
Journal_][wsj], [_Reuters_][reuters], and the [_FT_][ft] all emphasized the
central role of the [New York City pension funds][nyc], holder of 2.4 million
shares, which had launched a campaign to urge other shareholders to vote
against Lee Raymond at the upcoming annual shareholder's meeting. Credit was
also given to Majority Action, a shareholder activism group, which submitted a
[presentation][ma] arguing against Lee Raymond at the upcoming annual
shareholder's meeting.

Let's suppose that it was shareholder activism that led to this outcome. This
mechanism runs directly counter to Stop the Money Pipeline Coalition's
divestment goals. It is precisely because NYC pensions funds and others held
shares of JPMorgan Chase that they were able to exert some influence over the
company, something that wouldn't have happened if [activists have their
way][youth]. In theory, shareholders have a direct, legitimate,
institutionalized process through which they can influence the company, even
as a minority. Divestment involves abdicating those channels of influence in
favor of a vague, financial pressure that only seems to really work once the
vast majority of financial capital participates. Because until then, any
money divested from fossil fuel companies can easily be replaced by new
investment from other neutral investors. Indeed, there are ["vice
funds"][vice] which invest exclusively in companies involved in "sins" such
as alcohol, tobacco, and gambling (but not fossil fuels as far as I can
tell). Such funds would likely see divestment as an opportunity to earn
greater returns.

What, then, is the real impact of divestment campaigns? Do they actually make a
difference? I am no expert on this issue, but I did find an excellent 2013 [report] on
the impact of fossil fuel divestment from Oxford University. The first major
conclusion is that divestment campaigns are unlikely to have any direct
financial impact on fossil fuel companies due to the limited size of outflows
and the likely response from neutral investors who would be happy to pick up new
shares at a discount. In general, a company's market capitalization reflects its
long-term cash flow, which is unaffected by divestment.

## Size of Divestment

Let's get a sense of the numbers. A 2014 [Bloomberg report] stated that the
market value of the 1,744 publicly listed oil, gas, and coal companies were
collectively worth $4.88 trillion. The [Fossil Free] movement currently reports
divestment commitments from institutions managing a total of $14.14 trillion.
But that number is not representative of actual divestment.

First, it represents the total value of all investments managed by those
institutions, not the value of fossil fuel investments. The Oxford report
states that endowments and pension funds invest about 2-5% in fossil fuel
related equities and about half of that in fossil fuel related debt. For
instance, US university endowments have 2% of assets committed to fossil fuel
equities, whereas the CalPERS, the California state pension fund, in 2012 had
5.2% in fossil fuel equities. So if we take an average of 3.5%, then those
$14.14 trillion of commitments translates into $495 billion, or just over 10%
of the total market value of the fossil fuel industry. That's certainly quite an
achievement, but probably still not big enough to make a big dent.

Second, the actual amount of money divested is lower than the $495 billion we
just calculated, because many institutions are only partially divesting. Several
institutions are only divested from companies involved in coal or tar sands, often considered to be the
most environmentally harmful. The Bloomberg report stated that coal firms make
up less than 5% of the total fossil fuel industry, meaning that divestment only
from coal is only a tiny step toward full divestment. However, it seems that
only 96 of the 1198 institutions tracked by [Fossil Free] are committing to
coal or tar sands only, suggesting that the vast majority of institutions are going further.

It's also worth noting that most of these institutions have only committed to
divestment, but may not have actually gone through with them yet. Fossil Free
[distinguishes] between institutions that have made a binding commitment to
divestment and those that actual have zero investments. Only 58 are currently
categorized as totally fossil free, whereas another 920 institutions are
classified as having made a binding commitment toward full divestment. Granted,
it is likely that many of these institutions are already fully divested, but
just have not announced it.

## Indirect Effects of Divestment

In any case, the Oxford report states that the real impact of divestment
campaigns comes from indirect social and political effects. The bottom line is
that anything that can affect expectations around future cash flows would have a
durable effect on equity prices and interest rates for fossil fuel companies.
Divestment would have little effect on this, unless so much of the market
becomes antagonistic to fossil fuel companies that their cost of capital
increases. (The Oxford reports note that this is more likely to happen for
coal companies and companies in countries with lower availability of debt
financing.)

The first mechanism of indirect impact is stigmatization, whereby customers,
employees, suppliers, and others opt not to do business with a firm for
non-economic reasons. While I can see how this mechanism functions for
consumer-facing companies and even B2B or B2G companies, I have a hard time
envisioning how this would function for oil and gas companies, who seem so
many layers removed from most people's decision-making but also deeply woven into
our lives and thus difficult to excise. Perhaps another challenge is that oil
and gas are commodities, which aren't subject to the risks or benefits of a
brand (with the exception of gas stations). The Oxford report is not
much help, as its examples of stigmatization, such as Motorola's divestment from
its defense business and Revlon's divestment from its South Africa operations,
are for consumer-facing businesses. The report does note that the Exxon Valdez
and Deepwater Horizon oil spills triggered some changes, but I don't think that
these are the right examples to use for stigmatization, as they were the result
of acute disasters followed by investigations and litigation, rather than the
accumulation of stigmatization through sustained campaigning.

The second mechanism of indirect impact is through the threat of restrictive
legislation, such as a carbon tax or tightened regulations. The Oxford report
points out that such legislation does not even need to be enacted to have an
impact, as the mere increased probability of such legislation is enough to
reduce expectations about future oil and gas revenues, or at least increase
their uncertainty. The report states that past divestment campaigns have
often been successful in lobbying for restrictive legislation. While there's no
doubt that divestment can only help the cause for restrictive legislation, it's
unclear how effective they were compared to other parallel campaigns. For
instance, the only concrete example given in the Oxford report is
the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which is frequently attributed
to the 1964 Surgeon General report on the health effects of tobacco. Health
research played a clear role, but it's unclear what role divestment campaigns
in particular played in generating the political pressure to legislation.

I would add a third mechanism of indirect impact left undiscussed in the Oxford
report. Fossil fuel campaigns may have been one of the more effective
vehicles for getting people involved in climate issues and climate activism. It
might be one of the main ways that many college students in particular learn
about climate impacts and start thinking about climate solutions. Divestment
campaigns benefit from a simple narrative ("stop funding destruction") and
political battlegrounds located at universities. Endowments and
pension funds are good political targets, because they are large enough to
generate the excitement of an audacious goal, not as politicized as
legislative politics, and they have the spirit of serving a group of
people, even if there may not always be a formal mechanism for democratic
influence. Because the impacts of climate change are so diffuse and
probabilistic, it can be quite hard to generate political energy and activism.
Divestment campaigns might be one of the most effective ways to frame the
climate crisis in a way that gets people energized to fight rather than feel
overwhelmed. Political narratives need an enemy, and fossil fuel corporations
and their financiers can play that role, even as we are also complicit in our
fossil fueled lifestyles.

All this suggests that if you are an individual in control of
personal or institutional funds, simply divesting from fossil fuels
won't make any difference unless you tell other people. Ironically, as a
institutional fund manager, you might have a larger impact by dragging out the
divestment process in a way that allows the divestment movement to grow and
achieve milestones at regular intervals so that they feel empowered and
encouraged. Giving into divestment too quickly could collapse your local
divestment campaign, which may be serving as a crucial organization that
provides political training and experience to its members and climate
communication to the broader community. Perhaps we should start a covert
campaign to get institutional fund managers to divest, but slowly!
